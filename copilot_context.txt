Project overview & goals

    Goals
        Understand how an FNN learns on images (flattening, weights, activations).
        Learn training loop, loss, optimizer, scheduler, early stopping.
        Practice regularization (dropout, L2), and optimizer effects.
        Visualize what hidden units / first-layer weights look like.
        Compare metrics (train vs val) and inspect confusion matrix.

    Expected outcome
        A working FNN trained on Fashion-MNIST (re-usable code).
        Plots for training curves and confusion matrix.
        Practical understanding of FNN limits on image tasks.
